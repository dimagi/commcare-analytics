# This file is used to keep track of which feature branches
# should be in the `staging` branch.
# How it works:
# 1. Add your feature branch to the end of the list
# 2. Run ./scripts/rebuildstaging to rebuild the `staging` branch
# 3. Push the `staging` branch and deploy the code (this is a manual process at the moment)
